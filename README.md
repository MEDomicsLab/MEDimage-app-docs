# 👋 Welcome!

{% hint style="warning" %}
**MEDimage is now MEDiml.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This application represents the latest version of the radiomics module used in the MEDomics platform. We strive to keep both synchronized.
{% endhint %}

Welcome to the MEDiml-app documentation, where you will find all the resources you need to download, install and use the application.

### MEDomics

This application is part of the [MEDomics ](https://medomics-udes.gitbook.io/medomicslab-docs)project. It provides a graphical user interface to interact with the [MEDiml package](https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDimage), enabling users to extract radiomics features from medical images and analyze the data using machine learning models.

### The MEDiml application

The MEDiml-app is a graphical implementation of the MEDiml Python package. It enables the use of all MEDiml functionalities through an interactive interface. These functionalities include image processing, radiomics feature extraction, and machine learning tools.

### Our goal

The goal of the MEDiml app is to facilitate radiomics analyses for researchers from various disciplines and push for greater synergy among multidisciplinary teams. To achieve this, the application allows users to design their own experiments by customizing pipelines and defining specific settings. The back-end code is implemented in a modular way, ensuring easy adaptation and modification to meet diverse research needs. Additionally, users can generate Python code for their designed experiments, enabling reproducibility and further customization. With its intuitive interface and robust capabilities, the MEDiml app is designed to enhance research efficiency and collaboration. The following figure depicts the different parts of the app:
